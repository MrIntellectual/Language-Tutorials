# Advanced Operators

## Start

In this file I am going to teach you about advanced operators. There are three more types we are going to learn about - Assignment Operators, Relational Operators, and Logical Operators.

## Assignment Operators

The Assignment Operators are basically shortcuts for making a variable be equal to a number (operator) itself:

- `+=`
- `-=`
- `*=`
- `/=`
- `%=`

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int three = 3;
  int four = 4;

  int answerUsed = 0;
  std::cout << "The original variable is: " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed += four;
  std::cout << "The variable + 4 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed -= three;
  std::cout << "The newly added variable - 3 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed *= four;
  std::cout << "The newly subtracted variable * 4 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed /= three;
  std::cout << "The newly multiplied variable / 3 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed += 4;
  answerUsed %= four;
  std::cout << "The newly divided variable (and 4 added for demonstration purposes) % 4 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
The original variable is: 0
The variable + 4 = 4
The newly added variable - 3 = 1
The newly subtracted variable * 4 = 4
The newly multiplied variable / 3 = 1
The newly divided variable (and 4 added for demonstration purposes) % 4 = 1
```

## Relational Operators

Relational Operators are operators which compare things together:

- `<`
- `>`
- `<=`
- `>=`
- `==`
- `!=`

`<` means less than. \
`>` means greater than. \
`<=` means less than or equal to. \
`>=` means greater than or equal to. \
`==` means equal to. \
`!=` means not equal to.

All of the above operators check the conditions. Like `==` checks if they are equal.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  bool boolean1 = 4 < 3;
  bool boolean2 = 4 > 3;
  bool boolean3 = 4 <= 3;
  bool boolean4 = 4 >= 3;
  bool boolean5 = 4 == 3;
  bool boolean6 = 4 != 3;

  std::cout << boolean1 << std::endl
            << boolean2 << std::endl
            << boolean3 << std::endl
            << boolean4 << std::endl
            << boolean5 << std::endl
            << boolean6 << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
0
1
0
1
0
1
```

## Logical Operators

Logical Operators are the operators which are used when comparing one more things together. This means like when you want to check if `4 < 3` _and_ `5 < 3` are true at the same time, you use these:

- `&&`
- `||`
- `!`

`&&` means and. \
`||` means or. \
`!` means not.

The above operators are used with two Relational Operator statements or with two of other things. Like if you have `4 > 5 || 4 != 5` the result will be `1` because `1` stands for true and at least one of the two statements are true (`4 != 5`) and we said `||` so only one of them have to be true. `&&` means both / all of them have to be true and `!` means the result is reversed (`true` = `false` and `false` = `true`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  bool boolean1 = 4 < 3 && 5 > 3;
  bool boolean2 = 4 < 3 || 5 > 3;
  bool boolean3 = !(4 < 3);

  std::cout << boolean1 << std::endl
            << boolean2 << std::endl
            << boolean3 << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
0
1
1
```

**Note: In the Logical and Relational Operators output, 0 means false and 1 means true. These type of operators are mostly not used like this, and are instead used in while and for loops, and in if statements.**
