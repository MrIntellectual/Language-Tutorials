# Setup

## Start

So, in C++ files, there are some things you need to add at the start of the document. `#include <iostream>` includes a package in C++ which lets you use `cout` and `cin` which are the keywords for character output and character input. In some beginner programmer's programs, you may see `using namespace std;` at the starting too, which lets you use a lot of functions without needing to write `std::functionName` all the time. This is useful, but it sometimes includes functions you don't need and you didn't know were there, resulting with you creating a function with the same name which is used in a function in the namespace. The `int main() {}` is where you will put your code. Your code goes inside the curly braces `{}`. This creates a function called main, which is automatically run when you run the file, and the code inside the braces is what will be run.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Some code goes here. By the way this is a comment ðŸ˜„
}
```

### Output

```shell
# Nothing
```

## Comment

In the code before I wrote a comment. A comment in C++ is written with a `// `.

### Code

```cpp
int main() {
  // Tis is a comment
  /*
  This
  is
  a
  multi-level
  comment
  */
}
```

### Output

```shell
# Nothing is outputted
```
