# Variables

## Start

Variables are containers which hold a specific something. They are words which contain something in them, which you can call or take by just typing out the word. Variables in C++ are created by first typing out their type. Each variable has a type, and there are a few types of variables:

- `int`
- `float`
- `double`
- `std::string`
- `char`
- `bool`

## Explanation

The `int` variable type means an integer, which means a whole number. \
The `float` variable type means a single-precision decimal value. \
The `double` variable type means a double-precision decimal value. \
The `std::string` variable type means a string or a / some word(s). Strings are encased in double quotes "". \
The `char` variable type means a character. `char` stands for character, which means one number or letter. `char`s are encased in single quotes ''. \
The `bool` variable type means a `true` or `false` variable. The values it can be are those itself.

## Declaration

You declare a variable by typing the variable type before the name of the variable. You then give an equal to sign an write the value you want the variable to contain.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int number = 4;
  float decimal = 3.5;
  double bigDecimal = 3.456;
  std::string aString = "Hello";
  char character = 'k';
  bool boolean = true;

  std::cout << number << std::endl
      << decimal << std::endl
      << bigDecimal << std::endl
      << aString << std::endl
      << character << std::endl
      << boolean << std::endl
}
```

### Output

```shell
4
3.5
3.456
Hello
k
true
```
