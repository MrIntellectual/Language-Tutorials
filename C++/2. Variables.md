# Variables

## Start

Variables are containers which can hold values of a specific type. They are words which contain something in them, which you can call or take by just typing out the word. Variables in C++ are created by first typing out their type. Each variable has a type, and there are an infinite number of types that you can create. The language provides a few primitives types, which can be used to build larger, or more complicated types, here are a few:

- `bool`
- `char`
- `short`
- `unsigned`
- `int`
- `long`
- `float`
- `long long`
- `double`

## Explanation

The `bool` type means a boolean, which can only be `true` or `false`. The values it can be are those itself.
The `char` type means a (ASCII) character. `char` stands for character, which means one number or letter. `char`s are encased in single quotes ''.
The `short` type means a short integer. It can usually hold integers as smaller than `int`, and may take less space.
The `int` variable type means an integer, which means a whole number.
The `unsigned` type means an unsigned integer. Unsigned refers to how it lacks a sign, as in a `+` or `-` sign. For example, `4` is a valid value of `unsigned`, whereas `-4` is not. It can hold (slightly) higher positive values, yet no negatives.
The `long` variable type means a long integer, it can hold up to values as large as or larger than `int`.
The `float` variable type means a single-precision decimal value.
The `long long` variable type means a longer integer, it can hold up to values as large as or larger than `long`.
The `double` variable type means a double-precision decimal value.

**Note: No primitive has infinite precision, for example, `short`s usually cannot hold values <= 70000, and `char` can only hold [ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/) or [ASCII-Extended](https://www.ascii-code.com/#extendedASCIIDescription).**

## Declaration

You declare a variable by typing the variable type before the name of the variable. You then give an equal to sign and write the value you want the variable to contain.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  bool boolean = true;
  char character = 'k';
  short smallNumber = 2;
  int number = -4;
  unsigned positive = 4;
  long largeNumber = 7000000;
  float decimal = 3.5;
  long long largerNumber = 70000000;
  double bigDecimal = 3.456;

  std::cout << std::boolalpha // ignore boolalpha, it will be mentioned later
      << number << std::endl
      << boolean << std::endl
      << character << std::endl
      << smallNumber << std::endl
      << number << std::endl
      << positive << std::endl
      << largeNumber << std::endl
      << decimal << std::endl
      << largerNumber << std::endl
      << bigDecimal << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
true
k
2
-4
4
7000000
3.5
70000000
3.456
```
