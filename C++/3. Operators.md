# Operators

## Start

C++ provides certain operators which perform addition, and things like that. In this file, I will teach you the basic arithmetic operators:

- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`

## What they do

The `+` operator adds two numbers. \
The `-` operator subtracts two numbers. \
The `*` operator multiplies two numbers. \
The `/` operator divides two numbers.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  double three = 3.0;
  double four = 4.0;

  double addition = three + four;
  double subtraction = four - three;
  double multiplication = three * four;
  double division = four / three;

  std::cout << addition << std::endl
            << subtraction << std::endl
            << multiplication << std::endl
            << division << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
7
1
12
1.33333
```

## Types

One problem that beginners may face when using C++ is truncation. In the last example we had the **double** 4.0 and the **double** 3.0 dividing: `4.0 / 3.0`. The result of that was (1.33333...). `double` means double-precision, that is, when compared to a `float`. `double` and `float` are number types that can hold integers, decimals, infinity (inf), or not-a-number (nan), whereas integer types can only hold, well... *integers*. If you were to do `4 / 3`, this would perform integer division, and would return another integer, meaning that the would-be decimal places are lost.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int integer = 4 / 3;

  std::cout << "The integer result is: " << integer << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
The integer result is: 1
```
