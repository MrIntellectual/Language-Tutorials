# Operators

## Start

There are certain operators which do addition, and things like that in C++. In this file, I will teach you the basic operators:

- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`

## What they do

The `+` operator adds things together. \
The `-` operator subtracts two things. \
The `*` operator multiplies things together. \
The `/` operator divides two things. \
The `%` operator find the reminder of a division.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int three = 4;
  int four = 3;

  int addition = three + four;
  int subtraction = three - four;
  int multiplication = three * four;
  int division = three / four;
  int remainder = three % four;

  std::cout << addition << std::endl
            << subtraction << std::endl
            << multiplication << std::endl
            << division << std::endl
            << remainder << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
7
1
12
1
1
```

## Truncation

One major thing in C++ is truncation. As you may or may not have noticed, in the last example we had the **integer** 4 and the **integer** 3 dividing: `4 / 3`. The result of that was 1. The decimal points got truncated because the variable in which the result of that operation was stored was an integer. <!--If anyone find a way to fix this and make it show the decimal please tell me. I thought double or float would work but they don't too-->

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int integer = 4 / 3;

  std::cout << "The integer result is: " << integer << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
The integer result is: 1
```
