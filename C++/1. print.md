# Print

## Start

Printing is like outputting to the console. You make something appear in the console. In C++ you do that a little different. You don't type `print` like you do in Python. In the [previous](0.%20Setup.md) file I had talked about `cout` and `cin` which is what we use for printing and taking inputs. First - `cout`:

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // You will learn variables next so bear with me or skip to the next file to understand this. Also almost all the lines in C++ end with a semicolon ';'
  std::string var = "";

  std::cout << "Hoi" << " there: ";
  std::cin >> var;

  std::cout << "Your variable " << var;
}
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi there: # Input is taken here. Also this is a comment in the shell
# Inputted thing is outputted here
```

Some more explanation: To end and start a new line you use `\n` in a string (meaning double or single quotes) or you use `<< std::endl` at the end of the `cout` statement. We haven't done either of those things here on line 11 because we want the input to be taken on the same line. Automatically a new line is started after an input, meaning the next `cout` statement on line 14 is automatically printed on the next line.
