# Print

## Start

This markdown file, will show you how to use `print()`. This function prints out certain things to the console. Example:

### Code

```python
print("Hoi Boi")
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi Boi
```

## Concatenate

So, to concatenate text together, you can use `,` or `+` in the `print()` statement. Example:

### Code

```python
print("Hoi" + "BOI")
```

### Output

```shell
HoiBOI
```

### Code

```python
print("Hoi", "BOI")
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi BOI
```

You can clearly see the difference there - `+` adds the strings together directly without doing anything, so you have to add the spaces yourself, but with the `,` spaces are automatically added. Use `,` when you can, but use `+` when you need to.

## Sep

To change what divides the strings when using the `,` you can have a `sep=` property after another comma. As you can guess - the default sep value is a space.

### Code

```python
print("Hoi", "BOI", sep="~")
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi~BOI
```

## `+`

One problem with `+` - because it doesn't do anything and **actually** adds the strings together, you can't add numbers and decimals with a string using this.

### Code

```python
print("Moi number is: " + 3)
```

### Output

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

This error can be fixed by setting the number to a string using the `str()` function, or by using commas like we said earlier.

### Code

```python
print("Moi number is: " + str(3))
```

### Output

```shell
Moi number is 3
```

## Extra: Comments

Comments in Python are written using a `#` followed by a space.

### Code

```python
# Tis is a comment
'''
This
is
a
multi-level
comment
'''
```

### Output

```shell
# Nothing is outputted. Also this is a comment in the shell
```
