# Print

## Start

This markdown file, will show you how to use `print()`. This function prints out certain things to the console. Example:

### Code

```python
print("Hoi Boi")
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi Boi
```

## Concatenate

So, to concatenate text together, you can use `,` or `+` in the `print()` statement. Example:

### Code

```python
print("Hoi" + "BOI")
```

### Output

```shell
HoiBOI
```

### Code

```python
print("Hoi", "BOI")
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi BOI
```

You can clearly see the difference there - `+` adds the strings together directly without doing anything, so you have to add the spaces yourself, but with the `,` spaces are automatically added. Use `,` when you can, but use `+` when you need to.

## `+`

One problem with `+` - because it doesn't do anything and **actually** adds the strings together, you can't add numbers and decimals with a string using this.

### Code

```python
print("Moi number is: " + 3)
```

### Output

```shell
ERROR
```
