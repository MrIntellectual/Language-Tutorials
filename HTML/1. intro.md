HTML is a markup language, meaning that it is used to create webpages, so it's not like a normal programming language like Python

___

HTML is structured by tags, which make elements, here is an example of a tag - `<html>`

And here is an example of an element `<html></html>`

Each element has a opening tag and a closing tag, the opening tag has a `<` to begin and a `>` to end. The closing tag has a `<` to begin and a `/>` to end. Everything else between the opening and closing tags is either content or other nested elements

There is an exception though, there are self closing tags, that don't have any content between them and they can be structered in two ways. With a `<` to begin and a `>` to end. And a `<` to begin and a `/>` to end.

Here is the neccesary code to start a webpage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>

	</head>
	</body>

	</body>
</html>
```
