HTML is a markup language that is used to create webpages, so it's not like a programming language like Python
___
HTML is structured by tags and content which make up elements. There are 2 types of HTML Elements.

* The first type of elements has a opening tag and a closing tag, the opening tag has a `<` to begin and a `>` to end. The closing tag has a `<` to begin and a `/>` to end. Everything else between the opening and closing tags is either content or other nested elements


* The second type of elements is selfs closing tags, that don't have any content between them and it is structured with a `<` to begin and a `>` to end. They're also called void elements and what that means is that it can't contain any nested Elements, Comments, and any Character data.

Here is the neccesary code to start a webpage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>

	</head>
	</body>

	</body>
</html>
```

Here is what the Doctype Decleration - `<!DOCTYPE html>` means according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype)
> In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document; that is, the "<!DOCTYPE html>" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

___

Comments are blocks of text that is ignored when the browser is trying to render the webpage. The syntax goes like
```html
<!--Anything can go here-->
```
