# Operators
There are many operators in CookeyLang, and many are synonymous with what you can find in other languages.
```clf
1 + 2;
1 - 2;
1 * 2;
1 / 2;
1 ^ 2;
1 % 2;
```

|`+`|Add|
|`-`|Subtract|
|`*`|Times|
|`/`|Divide|
|`^`|Power|
|`%`|Modulo|

## Review
With these operators, we are now able to make more interesting programs:
```clf
printLine("1 + 1 = " + (1 + 1));
```
