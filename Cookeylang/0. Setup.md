# Setup
Before we can start coding CookeyLang, we must be able to run our projects!
First, we must install node + npm.
Second, we install cookeylang like this:
```sh
npm i cookeylang -g
```
From here on out, when you are prompted with this:
```
cookeylang main.clf
```

it should run the `main.clf` in the cwd.
