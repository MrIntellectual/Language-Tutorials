# Italics, Bold, and Italic & Bold

## Start

You can make text italicized, bolded, and both at the same time. This is pretty cool, and it lets you give emphasis and strengthen a point that you are writing.

## How TODO

To create bold text, you can either use `__text__` or `**text**`. To make italic text you can either use `_text_` or `*text*`. To create bold and italic text at the same time, you can either use `*__text__*`, `__*text*__`, `**_text_**`, `_**text**_`, `***text***`, or `___text___`.

### Code

```markdown
**Bold** & **Bold** \
_Italic_ & _Italic_ \
_**Both**_ & **_Both_** & __*Both*__ & *__Both__* & ***Both*** & ___Both___
```

### Preview

**Bold** & **Bold** \
_Italic_ & _Italic_ \
_**Both**_ & **_Both_** & __*Both*__ & *__Both__* & ***Both*** & ___Both___

Something you can see in the code is that I have added a `\` at the end of two lines. What this does, is it starts a new line. It is like the `\n` keyword in coding languages. Markdown doesn't automatically start a new line, and the only way to do that is to skip two lines which actually leaves a one line gap between the two sentences or things. If we don't want that line, we can just add a space and a `\` at the end of the line.

**Note: In VS Code there is a glitch for the last one (`___Both___`) where it doesn't color code properly and it looks wrong. Ignore this as it still works the way it should. Also prettier will change all of the last 4 ones to match with the first two ones as the first two ones are the most common way they look.**
